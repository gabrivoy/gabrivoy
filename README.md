## Hi Everyone! Glad you found me!

I’m Gabriel Ribeiro, also known at @gabrivoy in social media and online games.

I have a degree in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Since the start of my undergraduate studies, I was interested in computation and data driven technologies, which lead me to mix my knowledge in both areas and pursue data science for my career.

I work at [Shape Digital](https://shapedigital.com/) as a Junior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer, working in data driven solutions for the Oil and Gas industry and insights for Preditctive Maintenance 4.0 (PdM 4.0).

I hope I'll begin to populate more this space with side projects and open source projects that I'm developing.

You can find me on my social media linked below, mail me or connect with me on LinkedIn:
