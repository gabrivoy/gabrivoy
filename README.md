## Hi Everyone! Glad you found me 👋

I’m Gabriel, also known at @gabrivoy in social media and online games.

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with around 6 years building and operating production ML systems end-to-end: data pipelines, training workflows, real-time serving, monitoring, and evaluation. I enjoy working at the intersection of ML/LLMs, software engineering, and systems, partnering closely with product and domain experts to ship reliable solutions. 

I'm also pursuing a masters in Computer Science at PUC-Rio (you'll see a lot of my master's work here)!

Professional experience working in agile teams using Scrum’s Agile Methodology, concerned with product beyond its technical part, and generating the highest possible value within each delivery.

### What I work with
- Languages: Python (primary), SQL, (some) Go.
- Backend & APIs: FastAPI, Flask, Django, streaming APIs (SSE), stateful services.
- ML & Data: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, PySpark.
- LLMs & Retrieval: agent workflows (LangGraph), prompt engineering, hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse), reranking, vector databases (Qdrant, Milvus), offline evaluation (MAP@K, nDCG@K, MRR).
- MLOps & Infrastructure: Docker, MLflow, Airflow, DVC, Terraform, CI/CD, testing (pytest), typing (MyPy/Pyright), linting (Ruff).
- Cloud & Platforms: AWS and Azure ecosystems (containerized deployments, storage, managed databases, observability).
- Observability: logs/metrics/tracing, ELK stack, Grafana/Loki.

### What I care about
- Develop research, models and solutions that bring real value to the world.
- Turning ambiguous real-world problems into well-defined ML systems.
- Reproducibility, evaluation rigor, and deployment reliability.
- Clean interfaces, strong typing, and maintainable pipelines over "notebook-only ML".

### Other than coding
- I have a beautiful wife which is a major nerd flex.
- I am a Christian ✝️ and enjoy a lot philosophy and theology.
- I've been "redeveloping" my reading abilities after years on engineering reading only technical books: I've been reading a lot of C.S. Lewis right now.
- I'm very big on videogames, and play a lot of League (although hard-stuck emerald) and Monster Hunter (sometimes online chess too).
- Once I was a Jiu-Jitsu blue belt, but took an arrow to the knee. You know the story...
- Enjoy spending time with loved ones and friends a lot.
